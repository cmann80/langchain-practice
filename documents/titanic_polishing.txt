As we float about in our spectral state post-Titanic, it's time for a bit of an otherworldly performance review for our resident brass polisher. Now, don't get me wrong, the chap did try to keep the brass spick and span amidst the hustle and bustle of our once majestic vessel. There was a certain charm in seeing him hustle, rag in hand, giving those brass railings a good rub, even if at times it seemed like he was just moving the tarnish from one end to the other.

It's a bit of a giggle, really, considering we're all here in the great beyond, reminiscing about the good ol' days of gleaming metalwork. Sure, there were spots missed, and perhaps the occasional brass fitting didn't quite blind us with its brilliance, but let's give credit where it's due. The effort to make those banisters and telescopes dazzle was no small task, especially with the ship being as grand as she was. In the grand scheme of things, or should I say the grand scheme of afterthings, it's these little quirks and foibles that add a touch of levity to our eternal voyage. Here's to our brass polisher, who, in trying to make things shine, brought a bit of light-heartedness to our spectral crew.
